Ved Mehta solved the structure of mycobacterial adenylyl cyclase Cya and discovered an additional density in its transmembrane domain.
He mutated the residues surrounding the density and studied the mutated protein with biophysical methods.
I performed limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) to compare the protease accessibility of the mutated and the wild type protein. 
LiP-MS showed substanital differences in the accessibility of the helical domain that links the transmembrane domain to the catalytic domains of the protein.
